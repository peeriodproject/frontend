Peeriod is an open source project which strives for making privacy protected peer-to-peer file sharing available to the masses.
Peeriod’s aim is to construct Onion Routing on top of a DHT, while at the same time avoiding certificate authorities. Each node is equally (un)trustworthy and can act as a relay node for encrypted traffic. A flooding-based search takes advantage of the DHT’s structure and provides full-text search capabilities.

# Peeriod Core

__We are currently working on a larger wiki and an accompanying generated code documentation. For a detailed description of the implemented concepts, see the two linked PDFs above for now.__

This repository contains the code of Peeriod's interface which lives in the browser and communicates with the [core](https://github.com/peeriodproject/core).

Currently the interface has only been implemented as a __Chrome browser extension__.
